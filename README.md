# Tutor Management Portal
A comprehensive full-stack platform designed to streamline the scheduling and administration of tutoring services. This project focuses on multi-role access control and persistent data management.

## Overview
The Tutor Management Portal provides a centralized dashboard for 3 distinct user roles: Students, Tutors, and Administrators. It replaces manual scheduling with an automated, role-based system that handles everything from session booking to profile management.

## Technical Implementation
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implemented distinct dashboards for Students (booking), Tutors (availability management), and Admins (system oversight).

CRUD Operations: Developed a robust backend to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for user profiles, tutor specialties, and appointment slots.

State Management: Handled complex scheduling logic to prevent double-bookings and manage timezone-aware session slots.

## Key Features
Admin Dashboard: Full oversight of all users and sessions with the ability to modify or delete any entry

Tutor Availability: Tutors can dynamically set and update their availability slots

Appointment Scheduler: A seamless booking flow for students to find tutors by subject and time

Authentication: Secure login and registration system for all users.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: XML

Backend: Java

Database: Firebase

Tools: Git, Android Studio, 

Developed as a collaborative group project for __SEG2105__ at the University of Ottawa.
